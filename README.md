# Demeter

---

This is the Demeter project.

This project is focused to the management of character and accounts and their Planetary Interaction in the MMORPG Eve Online.

---

What we can offer ?
- A simple connection with [EvE SSO](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/single-sign-on) or with a standard email/password account.
- A character manager (each API Key can have one or more character and you can select what character to show and in which order)
- A simple overview for each character with all planets and what they're doing.
- A modulable overview (You can choose what you want to show !)
- A simple view of the POS you're using (if you use one, you can add it from same account page as character managment, cause you need api keys too) and how much fuel is remaining.

---

What this overview can contain ?
- Resume of Structures on the planet (how much of each structures)
- Extractors, what they extract and time remaining until the end of the cycle
- Launchpad/Storage and what they contains
